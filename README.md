# MSSQL Database on Railway ticket system

This project is an MSSQL database for an e-ticket train system. It follows third normal form (3NF) for most of the tables and has one or two tables in second normal form (2NF). The project includes an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to help visualize the database schema.

Additionally, the project includes use-case queries that utilize joins and some dynamic SQL automation based on stored procedures.
